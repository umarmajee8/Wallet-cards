# CardWallet (patched)

This repo contains the patched source for the CardWallet app.

## Changes made
1. Removed the "Make your own pouch" custom color-picker feature (both the header menu entry and the Settings-screen row).
2. Added two new fixed pouch presets, selectable from Settings -> **Pouch style**:
   - **Frosted** (original default)
   - **Steel** - dark slate/blue-grey look
   - **Emerald** - dark green look
3. Removed the **Auto-detect details** feature (Settings toggle, “Fill in from picture” button, and OCR on new photos). Card details are only what you type in.
4. Production hardening: release signing with a real RSA-4096 keystore
   (the debug key is retired) and `android:allowBackup="false"` so card photos
   and details never leave the app sandbox via cloud/adb backup.

## Structure
- `app/` - the web bundle that runs inside the Android WebView (Capacitor-based hybrid app): `index.html`, the compiled/minified `index.js`, `index.css`, and icons.
- `android/AndroidManifest.xml` - the app's Android manifest.
- `patches/` - Python scripts that patch the minified `index.js` (patch1 -> patch5),
  plus the release toolchain: `build_release_apk.py` (build + sign),
  `apkbuilder.py` (aligned zip, v1/v2/v3 signing, PKCS#12 keystore),
  `axml.py` (binary manifest reader/patcher), `verify_release.py`,
  `smoke_test_webview.mjs` and `animation_audit.py`.
- `signing/` - production keystore + password (gitignored, never committed).
- `CardWallet_no_pouch.apk` - previous signed build (pouch changes only).
- `../CardWallet_no_autodetect.apk` - superseded debug-signed build (do not ship).
- `../CardWallet_release.apk` - current production release-signed APK.

## Build notes

**Release builds (current):** `python3 patches/build_release_apk.py` produces
`../CardWallet_release.apk` - the web bundle is injected into the base APK, the
binary manifest is hardened (`allowBackup=false`), every stored entry is 4-byte
aligned, and the package is signed **v1 + v2 + v3 with the production RSA-4096
keystore** in `signing/release-key.p12` (gitignored - back it up).
See `../docs/RELEASE.md`.

Verification gates:
- `python3 patches/verify_release.py ../CardWallet_release.apk` - 26 package checks
- `node patches/smoke_test_webview.mjs` - 28 web-layer checks (`npm i jsdom`)
- `python3 patches/animation_audit.py` - static jank audit

On-device testing is **not** covered by any of the above - see
`../docs/DEVICE_TEST_PLAN.md` and the current status in `../docs/FINAL_REPORT.md`.

**Legacy:** `patches/rebuild_apk.py` signed with a throwaway debug key and is
kept for history only. `../CardWallet_no_autodetect.apk` is that old
debug-signed build - **do not distribute it**.
